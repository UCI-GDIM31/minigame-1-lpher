## Devlog
The Scene is like an aquarium tank. Its where everything exists. The GameObjects are like the fish, rocks, plants, and decoration in the tank. They are the individual items that exist in the tank, making up what you can see and interact with. The Components are like the traits and features of the fish, rocks, plants, and decorations. It determines what the color the fish is, what szie it is, how fast it swims, if it glows or not, and same things for the non-moving items like the rocks. Basically, the Scene is the tank or the world, the GameObjects are the things insids the Scene, and the Components are what gives each thing its looks, behaviors, and functions.
